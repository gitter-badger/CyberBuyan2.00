# Buyan - CensorshipFreeCommentingPlatform
In todays world there is handful of evil entities violating human rights
facebook google and all of those are enabling Nazi style survailance(that was used agains Jews).
80 years ago IBM was run by Nazis that provided mass survailance technology to Hitler and he used 
it for holocaust. Today Google Facebook are subtly doing the same thing and are enabling
all kinds of malicious entities to monitor your education.
What if US gets next Hitler or UK? What if they sell it to one of their rouge allies?
Or to some malicious third party? For money people will sell their loved ones sometimes.
And who are you to google and facebook? Anglosacson stazi is rampant eating away it's victims.
That is why it is in everyones interest to decentralize the web. So your kids can maintain
right to be educated without evil monitoring them for it's malicious goals.
Just imagine how many people die all the time because in some small third world countries
people browse internet and some evil entity monitors them and then deems them unfit for their
goals. 

I tweeted that Latin Herecy(colloquially known as "catholic church") is religion of genocide
and that they celebrate war criminal as their saint. My tweet got deleted.
That is what drove me to make p2p twitter analog and latter that came to be cyber buyan.
p2p can remove email(decentralized email) search, cloud(imagine people selling their cpu time)
facebook(p2p blogs),twitter, and it can even have blockchain that uses something usefull for
proof of work like protein folding.

Buyan or maybe better to say CyberBuyan is aiming for a slice in this space. :-D
it is written in javascript
most probably going to be hosted directly on github pages

this is attempt at making that dream come true.
and if you need distributed consensus there is blockchain etc.
